## üîå Publishing to the Main Website

The "Upload to Main Website" bulk action and row action now forward posts to your production site instead of returning mock data.

### Required Environment Variables

Add the following secrets to your admin panel runtime (e.g. `.env.local`):

```bash
ADMIN_SITE_SYNC_URL="https://<your-site-domain>/api/sync"
ADMIN_SITE_API_KEY="<shared-secret>"
```

- `ADMIN_SITE_SYNC_URL` should point to the base path that exposes the `POST /posts` sync endpoint described in the integration brief (e.g. `https://www.example.com/api/sync`).
- `ADMIN_SITE_API_KEY` is sent as an `x-api-key` header on every sync request. Rotate it per environment.

### Payload Contract

When a post is marked `published` or `scheduled`, the admin sends the following payload to `POST {ADMIN_SITE_SYNC_URL}/posts`:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "post_123",
  "slug": "paris-on-a-budget",
  "title": "Paris on a Budget",
  "excerpt": "A quick guide‚Ä¶",
  "body": "<h2>Intro</h2><p>‚Ä¶</p>",
  "featuredImage": {
    "url": "https://cdn.example.com/img/paris.webp",
    "alt": "Eiffel Tower at dusk",
    "width": 1600,
    "height": 900
  },
  "tags": ["europe", "budget"],
  "categories": ["city-guides"],
  "seo": {
    "title": "Paris on a Budget ‚Äì Love of Travel",
    "description": "How to do Paris cheaply."
  },
  "status": "published",
  "scheduledAt": null,
  "publishedAt": "2025-06-25T09:20:00Z",
  "version": 3
}
```

Validation enforced before syncing:

- Slug must already be kebab-case (`[a-z0-9-]`).
- Posts need HTML body content and at least one tag.
- Scheduled posts must include a future `scheduledAt` date.
- Featured images must use absolute CDN URLs (data URLs are rejected).

### Delivery Guarantees

- Each sync call includes a generated `Idempotency-Key` header.
- The admin retries failed attempts with exponential backoff (`0s`, `5s`, `30s`).
- Responses (success or failure) are logged to `data/site-sync-log.json` with `{entity, version, status, httpCode, idempotencyKey}` for auditing.

### UI Feedback

- Success toasts confirm when the live site acknowledges the post.
- Error toasts include the API error message and optional details returned from the site so editors can quickly resolve validation issues.

## üîß Mock Data

The system includes sample data:
- 3 sample blog posts with different statuses
